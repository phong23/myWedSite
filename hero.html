<p> Tony Stark, known as a hero of the Avengers. He was a CEO of Stark Industries and the magnificiant Iron Man. 
Stark was a genius and a billionaire. With his riches and knowledge of technology he easily had become one of the
most powerful human beings on the planet. With his expertise in technology he developed military grade weapons and 
the best of all, armored suits for himself. Right then, Stark had become a super hero in which fame and a secret 
identity came with it, which he enjoyed a lot. More importantly, Iron man was born. 

<p> I chose Tony Stark as hero because he is very inspirational. He sacrificed his life to save the galaxy and defeat
the most powerful villain.Captain America had gaven Stark the title of "Earth's best defender". Tony Stark showed 
everyone that in the beginning he was just and ordinary man. He created what everyone thought was impossible. Stark 
had constructed flying armor suits. Tony changed everyone's perspective on technology He showed the world that anything 
is possible.
